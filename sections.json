      "Every time you spend 💵 money you have to bargain with locals. It's really important for them. It's a kind of traditional way of modern marketing with discounts in the shop. People want not only to buy something, but they also want to feel the benefit. That's why discounts are important nowadays. But the bargain is a kind of a two-side discount. Also, it looks like two side auction with the theater elements.",
      "To show how it's important I can provide you an example. Somebody offers something for 100 000 tsh (~$45), but he is ready to sell it for 50 000 tsh (~$22.5). If you offer to buy it for 50 000 tsh (~$22.5) in the beginning he will definitely refuse it. But if you offer to buy it for 25 000 tsh (~11.25) and then he decreases his offer price and you increase yours he will be glad to sell it for 50 000 tsh (~$22.5) in the end. So 50 000 tsh (~$22.5) is not a good price for the seller, but 50 000 tsh (~$22.5) **with a bargain** is a good price.",

But a few days ago we realized it was not only our case here.",
      "It so unusual to celebrate 🎉 the New Year in a country like this. First of all, the atmosphere - there is no ❄️ snow and 🎄 Christmas trees there. But the more important thing is local people don't actually celebrate it here. So, the holiday you use to consider as global and worldwide is only your holiday here (and other tourists from countries like yours). At this moment you understand how far are you from home.",

      "This is the place where the 🧱 hotel wall can separate different people having dinner for $1 and $100. It's a place full of contrasts. For example, the island has problems with ⚡ electricity. It can be turned off several times per day, and nobody knows when will it work again. Sometimes it's felt like you are in a pretty wild place. I am not sure is there 🏥 a hospital at all.",
      "But people are kind and positive and smile all the time. Even when they try to cheaе you) And this is pretty common here (🍹 the drinks become more expensive when you ask for the check because of the \"party time\", the private boat with bigger price can become public, and the change can be forgotten). But when you note it to them they usually fix the problem without any conflicts.",

      "Watching the birds is really calm hobby, you are 🚶 walking in the forest and can collect photos of different birds and classify it. Try yourself if you haven't tried it yet. Just start from the closest part.",
      "If you are not in this hobby yet it's hard to notice the birds, but with a good guide, it's not a problem.",
      "I couldn't understand the uniquity of the birds I had watched. That's why I decided to start from the birds in the 🏙️ city - the simplest ones.",
      "Honestly, I had bought a binoculars and a bird's definer book and download the birds' application after this trip.",
      "So, next time I will be more 💪 prepared."
