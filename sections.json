      "> In the XIII century the town of Svityaz, ruled by Prince Turan, stood on the site of the lake. During the war with the Russian (Volyn) princes Mindauh called Svityazh's squad to help defend Navahrudak. Turan, obeying his duty, left the city for women, the elderly, and children.",
      "> When the enemy army approached Svityaz, the inhabitants decided to resist, but not being able to hold the city, they set fire to their houses. At this point, the city collapsed into a lake that formed in its place. All the inhabitants turned into flowers, and the enemies who touched them died. So the inhabitants of Svityaz escaped the shame of captivity."
