Also, you can rent bicycles and kayaks here.\n\nI have been there two times (in spring and 🍂 autumn) this year, because it's the kind of place you want to return to.\n\nYou will not find this place on booking or airbnb. It's a kind of filter for the guests of the house."

Wild forests and swamps are the ideal places for many kinds.\n\nWatching the birds is really calm hobby, you are 🚶 walking in the forest and can collect photos of different birds and classify it. Try yourself if you haven't tried it yet. Just start from the closest part.\n\nIf you are not in this hobby yet it's hard to notice the birds, but with a good guide, it's not a problem.\n\nI couldn't understand the uniquity of the birds I had watched. That's why I decided to start from the birds in the 🏙️ city - the simplest ones.\n\nHonestly, I had bought a binoculars and a bird's definer book and download the birds' application after this trip.\n\nSo, next time I will be more 💪 prepared."
