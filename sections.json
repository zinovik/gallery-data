      "Every time you spend üíµ money you have to bargain with locals. It's really important for them. It's a kind of traditional way of modern marketing with discounts in the shop. People want not only to buy something, but they also want to feel the benefit. That's why discounts are important nowadays. But the bargain is a kind of a two-side discount. Also, it looks like two side auction with the theater elements.",
      "To show how it's important I can provide you an example. Somebody offers something for 100 000 tsh (~$45), but he is ready to sell it for 50 000 tsh (~$22.5). If you offer to buy it for 50 000 tsh (~$22.5) in the beginning he will definitely refuse it. But if you offer to buy it for 25 000 tsh (~11.25) and then he decreases his offer price and you increase yours he will be glad to sell it for 50 000 tsh (~$22.5) in the end. So 50 000 tsh (~$22.5) is not a good price for the seller, but 50 000 tsh (~$22.5) **with a bargain** is a good price.",
      "It's like a game when the seller not only changes the good for the money but interacts with the buyer a lot.",
      "But it also has another side. If you can't do it well you feel cheated all the time. They start with really big prices and laugh when you offer the real ones, but then decrease theirs.

But a few days ago we realized it was not only our case here.",
      "It so unusual to celebrate üéâ the New Year in a country like this. First of all, the atmosphere - there is no ‚ùÑÔ∏è snow and üéÑ Christmas trees there. But the more important thing is local people don't actually celebrate it here. So, the holiday you use to consider as global and worldwide is only your holiday here (and other tourists from countries like yours). At this moment you understand how far are you from home.",

      "This is the place where the üß± hotel wall can separate different people having dinner for $1 and $100. It's a place full of contrasts. For example, the island has problems with ‚ö° electricity. It can be turned off several times per day, and nobody knows when will it work again. Sometimes it's felt like you are in a pretty wild place. I am not sure is there üè• a hospital at all.",
      "But people are kind and positive and smile all the time. Even when they try to chea–µ you) And this is pretty common here (üçπ the drinks become more expensive when you ask for the check because of the \"party time\", the private boat with bigger price can become public, and the change can be forgotten). But when you note it to them they usually fix the problem without any conflicts.",
      "Also, it's unusual to see African people who are Muslims. I don't know why. Maybe I haven't traveled enough before or not educated enough.",
      "Anyway, it's interesting not to bring your culture to the place you traveling to, but to dive into the local's life, to eat the local food, to go out of üõãÔ∏è the comfort zone. Traveling is a much more interesting thing than simply resting in another country.",
      "It's an interesting place. It's easy to find more comfort for this money in other places. But there are many things you can't find elsewhere.",

      "1. Firstly, you need to get to the spot. The waves are pretty big near the bank and try to interfere with you. You go (on this step, it's better to hold the board behind you), then you swim (here, if you see the white wave it's better to leave the board and go down).",
      "2. On the spot, you have to see the waves for yourself. Some of them are too big, and some of them are too small. The waves are grouped in sets. Probably it's one of the hardest parts - to find your wave. And it takes some time.",
      "3. Finally, there is a wave. You have to puddle as quickly as possible to the bank on your board. Your legs are starting to go up and your head is going down. And here is a really difficult moment. You have to get up as quickly as possible. Only one jump from lying down to standing on the board. And the board is not stable at that moment, it's moving! The majority of beginners get up too late.",
      "4. And the final part: your are on the wave. You are cool and happy but you have to remember about your position. If you are too behind you will stop pretty fast and the wave will go ahead without you.",
      "Go to step 1.",
      "If something went out of control you feel the how powerful ocean is. Even the small wave looks like tsunami when you are inside and you are absolutely helpless.",
      "But if everything ok it's a really nice feeling. You are high above the sea and it feels like the board has a powerful motor to drag you forward.",
      "One more advice: don't try to stay on board as long as possible. If you are losing the speed and the wave it's better to stop to save some strength going back not from the bank",
      "If you want to tame even a softboard (for beginners) take into account that it will take a lot of time and strength. It requires many days."

      "The game is about the flow of water and using it's power. Sometimes it's better to be above your opponents to steal their water but sometimes it's more convenient to be below of them to reuse it.",
      "Also, the resource wheel are interesting mechanics - you spend your resources but later it come back to you and you can use it again.",
