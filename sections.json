      "Every time you spend üíµ money you have to bargain with locals. It's really important for them. It's a kind of traditional way of modern marketing with discounts in the shop. People want not only to buy something, but they also want to feel the benefit. That's why discounts are important nowadays. But the bargain is a kind of a two-side discount. Also, it looks like two side auction with the theater elements.",
      "To show how it's important I can provide you an example. Somebody offers something for 100 000 tsh (~$45), but he is ready to sell it for 50 000 tsh (~$22.5). If you offer to buy it for 50 000 tsh (~$22.5) in the beginning he will definitely refuse it. But if you offer to buy it for 25 000 tsh (~11.25) and then he decreases his offer price and you increase yours he will be glad to sell it for 50 000 tsh (~$22.5) in the end. So 50 000 tsh (~$22.5) is not a good price for the seller, but 50 000 tsh (~$22.5) **with a bargain** is a good price.",
      "It's like a game when the seller not only changes the good for the money but interacts with the buyer a lot.",
      "But it also has another side. If you can't do it well you feel cheated all the time. They start with really big prices and laugh when you offer the real ones, but then decrease theirs. And sometimes there is a situation (for example, they have not many goods) they can üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è refuse any offers."

      "It seems the overbooking is a pretty common thing here. We didn't live in a hotel that was booked, because it was busy.

It's not the best feeling where you are in another hemisphere with winter clothes (üå°Ô∏è the temperature is +30 ¬∞C here), cash in the pockets, with all the baggage but without the place to sleep. But a few days ago we realized it was not only our case here.",
      "It so unusual to celebrate üéâ the New Year in a country like this. First of all, the atmosphere - there is no ‚ùÑÔ∏è snow and üéÑ Christmas trees there. But the more important thing is local people don't actually celebrate it here. So, the holiday you use to consider as global and worldwide is only your holiday here (and other tourists from countries like yours). At this moment you understand how far are you from home.",
      "If you stayed not in the expensive hotel with all-inclusive you switch between two conditions all the time here:",

      "2. Why is it happening with me, can anybody stop it?",
      "This is the place where the üß± hotel wall can separate different people having dinner for $1 and $100. It's a place full of contrasts. For example, the island has problems with ‚ö° electricity. It can be turned off several times per day, and nobody knows when will it work again. Sometimes it's felt like you are in a pretty wild place. I am not sure is there üè• a hospital at all.",
      "But people are kind and positive and smile all the time. Even when they try to chea–µ you) And this is pretty common here (üçπ the drinks become more expensive when you ask for the check because of the \"party time\", the private boat with bigger price can become public, and the change can be forgotten). But when you note it to them they usually fix the problem without any conflicts.",
      "Also, it's unusual to see African people who are Muslims. I don't know why. Maybe I haven't traveled enough before or not educated enough.",
      "Anyway, it's interesting not to bring your culture to the place you traveling to, but to dive into the local's life, to eat the local food, to go out of üõãÔ∏è the comfort zone. Traveling is a much more interesting thing than simply resting in another country.",
      "It's an interesting place. It's easy to find more comfort for this money in other places. But there are many things you can't find elsewhere.",
      "And it's unbelievable that you can turn on the hot summer anytime in the year. But it has the other side. You have to return to the country without the smiles after all."

At this point, the city collapsed into a lake that formed in its place. All the inhabitants turned into flowers, and the enemies who touched them died. So the inhabitants of Svityaz escaped the shame of captivity."
